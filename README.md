# Eagle1-VoltageDivider

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with Eagle and print an extremely basic circuit on the Voltera printer. 

Edit the provided .sch and .pcb files to create a voltage divider with 3 test points. 

The Sparkfun Eagle tutorials are useful. 

[Setting up Eagle](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-eagle) - This is a handy intro to the main ideas of EAGLE. Note that we aren't using the Sparkfun libraries (for now) so ignore this part. 

[Creating a schematic](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-schematic) - This steps you through making a much more complicated schematic than required for this assignment. If you want to do it, you will need to download the Sparkfun libaries (see above).

[Laying out a through hole board](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-board-layout) - This steps you through laying out and routing the pcb that corresponds to the schematic from the previous tutorial. This is all through hole, but for our simple circuit that doesn't matter. 


After you have finished laying out the board, create gerber files using cam processeror and the voltera-cam.cam file
